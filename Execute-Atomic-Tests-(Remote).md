You can use the `Invoke-AtomicTest` function to run an atomic test on the system where you installed Atomic Red Team (Local), or on a remote machine through a PowerShell Remoting session (Remote). These instructions show you how to execute tests on the Local machine. For instruction on executing tests on the Local Machine (where Invoke-AtomicRedTeam is installed) see [here](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/wiki/Execute-Atomic-Tests-(Local)).
